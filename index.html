      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Shelbs is the other name I get called. I'm a Digital Marketing Coordinator and have discovered that these days I'm most enjoying the technical side of marketing, including making small changes to code for our email sends outs and our websites.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Hong Kong, living in Perth since '01</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Finding new & fun places to walk with Otis my Dalmatian, checking out new bars with friends, painting, attending gigs and travelling (more and more within WA for obvious reasons)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Still would love to stay in marketing but more so web design and development- anything that means I could travel and work so long as I had access to my laptop and solid WIFI</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In my cute home in Osborne Park</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My current role works closely with web developers for our project websites. I would love to have total control of the web development process and be the ultimate marketer</p>
